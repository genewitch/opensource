how the pastebin was run;
start a fresh old ubuntu release that you can get these packages to work on (lol)
it sets up a 200MB ramdisk at /mnt/knoxious, we install nodejs npm
we get the actual pastebin from github (Up1)

So we're in the homedir ~/ and we manipulate the downloaded Up1 directory 
directly. we tell node package manager to make sure all packages are installed.

Now we're done. You can reboot and then write the bash script
and tell it to run on boot.
Since we told linux to always make a 200MB ramdisk on boot, we can
rsync with preserved permissions
chdir to the nodejs server folder (that we rsync'd)
and then nohangup & the invocation so that we don't need to ever be around.

echo "tmpfs /mnt/knoxious      tmpfs   size=200M,mode=0755     0       0" > /etc/fstab
mkdir /mnt/knoxious
mount -a
apt install nodejs npm
apt-get install nodejs
git clone https://github.com/Upload/Up1
cd Up1
cp server/server.conf.example server/server.conf #and edit api_key
cp client/config.js.example client/config.js     #and copy the api_key
cd server
npm install

#!/bin/bash
rsync -avz /home/ubuntu/Up1/ /mnt/knoxious
#chown -R www-data.www-data /mnt/knoxious/
#service nginx restart
cd /mnt/knoxious/server
nohup nodejs server.js &
